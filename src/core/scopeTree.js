   *
   * Index:Integer scopeEnterFunc(arrayOfAllLines:Array, lineToCheckIndex:Integer)
   * Index:Integer scopeExitFunc(arrayOfAllLines:Array, lineToCheckIndex:Integer)
   *

   * examine, and return the column within the line at which the scope is entered
   * or exited. If there is no scope change in the line, null must be returned.
   *
   * @param lines Array of lines to build the scope tree over.
   * @param index Current line number.
   * @param scopeEnterFunc Function with the above signature. It takes the full
   *        array of lines and the index of the line to examine, and returns
   *        the column within the line at which the scope is entered. If no scope
   *        is entered in the line, null must be returned.
